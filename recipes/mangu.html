        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This picture has the worst most bland plantain ever not gonna lie</p>
        <p>Creamy, rich and delicious, mangu is one of my favorite plantain recipes. Dominica mashed plantain is super simple to make, but is full of flavor. Serve as part of a breakfast, or as a side dish.        </p>
